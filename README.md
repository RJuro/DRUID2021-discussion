- identify configurations that deliver performance

## Feedback

- ambition to explore more complex configurations / specific cases between quant/qual

- what do we learn? Describing more â‰  explaining more?

    >In lightly regulated industries, knowledge-intensive firms in the majority of the identified cases were able to achieve high performance when they combined their process innovation with marketing innovation
